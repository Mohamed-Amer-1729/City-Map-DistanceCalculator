# City Distance Calculator

The project was created for CS2 Lab final project. It was worked on by 4 people, including me. I worked on the dijkstra algorithm.

The project uses Qt framework to give a visual display of cities inputted as nodes and cities connected as edges connecting them. The project is coded in C++ and uses elements of OOP.
